LangSmith is super handy for keeping an eye on your LangChain agents.\n\nThink of LangSmith as a flight recorder for your LLM applications. When you use it with LangChain agents, it captures every step, thought, and tool call your agent makes. This is incredibly useful for:\n\n*   **Debugging:** Understanding *why* your agent made a certain decision or got stuck.\n*   **Monitoring:** Seeing how your agent performs in real-world scenarios.\n*   **Optimizing:** Identifying bottlenecks or areas where your agent could be more efficient.\n\n### How to use LangSmith to monitor LangChain Agents:\n\nIt's pretty straightforward!\n\n1.  **Set up your Environment Variables:**\n    You'll need to tell your LangChain application where to send the traces.\n\n    ```bash\n    export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"\n    export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"YOUR_LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"\n    export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=\"Your_Agent_Project_Name\" # This will group your runs in LangSmith\n    ```\n    (You can find your API key in your LangSmith account settings.)\n\n2.  **Run Your LangChain Agent:**\n    Once those environment variables are set, just run your Python script that uses the LangChain agent as you normally would. LangChain is designed to automatically send traces to LangSmith when `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` is enabled.\n\n    ```python\n    # Example (assuming you have a LangChain agent set up)\n    from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor\n\n    # Your agent setup code here, e.g.,\n    # agent_executor = initialize_agent(...)\n\n    # Run your agent\n    response = agent_executor.invoke({\"input\": \"What's the weather like in New York?\"})\n    print(response)\n    ```\n\n3.  **View Traces in the LangSmith UI:**\n    After your agent runs, head over to the LangSmith UI (app.langsmith.com). You'll see your runs listed under the project name you specified (`Your_Agent_Project_Name`).\n\n    Click on any run, and you'll get a detailed trace showing:\n    *   The initial prompt.\n    *   Each thought process the agent goes through.\n    *   Every tool it calls (and the inputs/outputs of those calls).\n    *   The final response.\n\nIt's like having X-ray vision for your agent's brain! Let me know if you want to dive into a specific part of setting this up!", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "hi in the whastapp automation where u are being integrated , i have updaed the internal structure for live chat processment", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "Oh, interesting!
